        Why using not using arraylist? Because remove an element from an arrayList is time and space consuming

              8 9 0 7 3 4 2
        s1||
        s2||  0 2 3 4 7 8 9
              int globalMin = 9
              int size = 7


        M2: using just one stack
            8 9 0 7 3 4 2
        s|| 8 9 0 7 3 4 2

               int global = 2
