    * Q1:Given a string, we can insert at most one empty space between each pair of adjacent letters.
    *   Print all permutations of strings after insertions of empty spaces
    *   Input: str[] ="ABC"
    *   Output:
    *       ABC
    *       AB_C
    *       A_BC
    *       A_B_C

    * Q2: CHeck if two nodes are cousins in a Binary Tree
    * Given the bianry Tree and the two nodes say 'a' and 'b', determine the two nodes are cousins of each other or not.
    * Two Nodes are cousins of each other if they are at same level and have different parents.
    * Example:
    *        6
    *       / \
    *      3   5
    *     /\   /\
    *    7  8 1  2
    *
    *    7 and 1, return TRUE
    *    3 and 5, return False
    *    7 and 5, return False
    *
    * Q3: How to cut/split the number into a minimum number of items
    *  such that each item is equal to an integer's square value.
    *  For example: 4 can be split to 1+1+1+1(4 items) or 2^2(1 item, which is the solution)
    *  Return 1
    *  10 can be split to two items 3^2 +1^2 (solution) or four items 2^2+2^2+1^2+1^2
    *  Return 2
    *
    * Q4: Given an array of strings, find if all the strings can be chained to form a circle.
    * Two string s1 and s2 can be chained, if the last letter of s1 is identical to first letter of s2.
    * For example, "abc" and "cd" can be chained,
    * "abc" and "dz" can not be chained.
    * Example Input: arr[] = {"abc". "bbb", "baa", "aab"};
    * Output: True,
    * The given input string scan be chained to form a circle. The strings can be chained as "aaa"-"aab"-"bbb"-"baa".
