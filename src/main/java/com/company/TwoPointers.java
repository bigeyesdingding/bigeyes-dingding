    *   Two pointers, two ways of moving
    *   I: fast and slow moving in the same direction
    *   left part is the result we need, between left and right is we not care, right part is the one going to explore
    *
    *   II: fast and slow moving in different directions
    *   Both left and right parts are what we need, between left and right is what we are going to explore

    *Q1:
    *   1.1 a sorted array,  保留k个重复元素
    *   1.2 a sorted array， 不保留任何重复元素
    *   1.3 unsorted array, remove adjanct characters , eg: abbbbazw -> zw
    *   1.4 an array of random numbers, push all zero to the end of the array,
    *       1.4.1 order of other elements can be changed
    *       1.4.2 order of others have to be the same as input
    *
    *Q2: Array comparisons
    *   2.1 using the least times comparisions to find the largest and smallest number in the array
    *   2.2 using the least times of comparisons to find the largest and second largest number in the array
    *
    *Q3: Print Matrix
    *   3.1 how to print a 2D array in  spiral order(N*N)
    *   3.2 how to rotate an N*N matrix clockwise by 90 degree ??
    *
    *
    *Q4: BFS & Binary Tree Problems
    *   4.1 Classic way to print the tree level by level (queue)
    *   4.2 Classic way to print the tree level by level in a zig-zag way
